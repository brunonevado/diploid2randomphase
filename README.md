# diploid2randomphase
perl script to randomly solve IUPAC codes in diploid fasta sequences  

Reads fasta file with iupac-coded diploid sequence, and outputs new fasta file with 2 sequences per sample, with iupac codes solved randomly.
The new sequences are called name_1 and name_2  (where name is the original sequence name).
NOTE: This is not a phasing tool!
